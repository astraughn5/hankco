# Welcome to Hank Co.
<p align = 'left'>
Welcome to the random photo generator. This small application was built using the Unsplash API, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The idea came from wanting to practice API data retrieval and I have used Unsplash many times in the past and I was curious if they had an API.
</p>

## Functionality
A random photo will automatically load. To see another, like or dislike it. As you go through the photos, your like and dislike count will go up.

### Caution
Since this is a public API and free, I only have so many data requests per month. If the site does not retrieve a photo, this is most likely the case. To create your own API key, see below for details.
